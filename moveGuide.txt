distances:
1 -> move 1 step (ie. adgecent)
2 -> move 2 steps 
x -> move until interupted (like a rook)

direction:
+ -> general orthagonal
/ -> diagonal
f -> constrained to forward
l -> constrained to left
r -> constrained to right
b -> constrained to back

constraints:
c -> only a capture
m -> only a move
j -> only on the first move

grouping:
, -> seperate diferent move patterns
[] -> used for "bouncing" moves (ie: the lion from chu shogi)

examples:
a pawn for example would have the move "1|fm,2|fmj,1/fc"
a rook "x+"
