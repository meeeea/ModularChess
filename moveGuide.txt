distances:
1 -> move 1 step (ie. adgecent)
2 -> move 2 steps 
x -> move until interupted (like a rook)

directional constraints:
+ -> Lock orthagonal
/ -> Lock diagonal
f -> Lock forward
l -> Lock left
r -> Lock right
b -> Lock back
| -> or constraints

leaping moves (ie. knight from chess):
(d1,d2) -> selects all the points that can be accived with that move pattern.

move type constraints:
c -> only a capture
m -> only a move
j -> only on the first move
k -> canno't move into capture

grouping:
, -> seperate diferent move patterns
[] -> used for "bouncing" moves (ie: the lion from chu shogi)

examples:
a pawn for example would have the move "1+fm,2+fmj,1/fc"
a rook "x+"
a chess kight would be (1,2)
wereas a shogi knight would be (1,2)f
